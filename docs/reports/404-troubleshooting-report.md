# Landing Page 404 Error - Troubleshooting Report
*Resolution Date: 2025-09-26*

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Landing page (/) returning 404 error
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Stale Next.js build cache causing webpack runtime errors
**Resolution Time**: 15 minutes

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Corrupted Build Cache
Following systematic cleanup operations (dead code removal and dependency optimization), the Next.js `.next` build cache contained references to removed modules, causing:

```
⚠️ CRITICAL ERROR: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
   at webpack-runtime.js:1:143 { page: '/' }
```

### Contributing Factors
1. **Multiple concurrent dev servers** running simultaneously after cleanup
2. **Webpack module resolution** failing for removed dependencies
3. **React Server Component compilation** encountering undefined references
4. **Fast Refresh runtime errors** requiring full page reloads

## Diagnostic Process

### Following Codex Analysis Recommendations
Used Codex MCP to analyze potential causes:
- ✅ Port conflicts (checked `lsof -nP -iTCP:3000`)
- ✅ Route file structure (verified `src/app/page.tsx` exists)
- ✅ Component imports (confirmed all landing components present)
- ✅ Build cache corruption (identified as primary cause)

### Error Pattern Identification
```bash
# Error indicators observed:
- "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"
- "Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload"
- React Server Component compilation failures
- Webpack runtime module resolution errors
```

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Process Cleanup
```bash
# Kill all running development servers
pkill -f "next dev" && pkill -f "npm run dev"
```

### 2. Build Cache Clearance
```bash
# Remove corrupted build artifacts
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
```

### 3. Clean Server Restart
```bash
# Start fresh development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verification
```bash
# Confirm resolution
curl -I http://localhost:3000/
# Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅

# Server compilation logs:
# ✓ Compiled / in 2.6s (600 modules)
# HEAD / 200 in 2650ms
```

## Technical Details

### Before Resolution
- **HTTP Status**: 404 Not Found
- **Error Type**: Webpack runtime module resolution failure
- **Component Status**: All components present but uncompilable
- **Build State**: Corrupted cache with stale references

### After Resolution
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Compilation**: Successful (600 modules in 2.6s)
- **Component Status**: All landing page components loading correctly
- **Build State**: Clean cache with valid module references

## Prevention Measures

### For Future Cleanup Operations
1. **Proactive Cache Clearing**: Always clear `.next` after major file removals
2. **Single Server Policy**: Kill existing dev servers before starting new ones
3. **Verification Protocol**: Test root route access after cleanup operations
4. **Build Validation**: Run `npm run build` to catch compilation issues early

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check for stale processes
ps aux | grep "next dev"

# Verify route compilation
curl -s -I http://localhost:3000/ | head -n 1

# Monitor dev server logs for webpack errors
npm run dev 2>&1 | grep -E "(error|ERROR|fail)"
```

## Key Learnings

### Next.js Build Cache Management
- Build cache corruption is common after significant file structure changes
- Webpack module resolution errors manifest as 404s on affected routes
- Cache clearing is essential after cleanup operations

### Systematic Troubleshooting Approach
- **Codex Analysis**: Provided comprehensive diagnostic framework
- **Process of Elimination**: Methodically checked each potential cause
- **Evidence-Based Resolution**: Server logs confirmed successful fix

### Development Workflow Improvements
- Include cache clearing in cleanup procedures
- Monitor server logs for compilation issues
- Verify critical routes after structural changes

## Resolution Confirmation

**✅ Landing page now accessible**: http://localhost:3000/
**✅ Clean server compilation**: No webpack runtime errors
**✅ Full component rendering**: All landing page components loading
**✅ Development workflow restored**: Hot reload and Fast Refresh working
