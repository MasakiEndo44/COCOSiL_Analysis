# Business Plan Update Session - 2025-10-05

## Session Summary
Successfully updated COCOSiL business plan from outdated v1.0 (2025-08-18) to current v2.0 (2025-10-05) aligned with actual implementation status and external stakeholder requirements.

## User Requirements
- **Target Audience**: Corporate sponsors, business plan competition organizers, partner sales, company registration presentations
- **Business Stage**: Free beta for PMF validation (50-100 users)
- **Technical Debt**: Assume resolved (optimistic scenario)
- **Monetization Timeline**: 2026 Q2 (6 months)
- **Document Type**: Simplified version (key sections only)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Executive Summary
- Updated from mobile app (React Native) to web platform (Next.js 14)
- Emphasized PMF validation phase instead of immediate monetization
- Added privacy-first architecture as primary differentiator
- Clarified 4-stage roadmap: Beta → Feature completion → Monetization beta → Full launch

### 2. Technical Architecture
- Replaced planned stack (React Native + AWS + Supabase + Claude + Gamma) with actual implementation (Next.js 14 + Vercel + OpenAI + local storage)
- Highlighted client-side data storage for privacy protection
- Removed unimplemented Gamma API integration

### 3. Competitive Advantages
- **NEW Priority #1**: Privacy-first design (all data client-side only)
- Removed psychiatric supervision (not contracted)
- Removed Gamma API visual reports (not implemented)
- Kept 4 diagnosis methods integration (Taiheki, MBTI, Sanmeigaku, Animal Fortune)

### 4. Business Model
- Changed from immediate subscription (3-month launch) to staged rollout (1-year plan)
- Phase 1: Free beta with PMF metrics (retention 50%, NPS 40+)
- Phase 2: Monetization beta (2026 Q2) with Stripe integration
- Phase 3: Full launch (2026 Q4) with marketing expansion

### 5. Execution Plan
- Replaced 3-month aggressive timeline with realistic 4-stage plan:
  - Stage 1: Beta completion (2025 Q4)
  - Stage 2: Feature completion (2026 Q1)
  - Stage 3: Monetization prep (2026 Q2)
  - Stage 4: Full launch (2026 Q3-Q4)

### 6. NEW Section: Partnership Opportunities
Added stakeholder-specific value propositions:
- Corporate sponsors: Beta access, team diagnosis pilot
- Business plan competitions: Implemented product, technical innovation
- Partner sales: API integration, content collaboration
- Company registration: Conservative financial plan, risk management
