# PMF Validation 1-Month Practical Guide Creation

## Summary
Created comprehensive 1-month PMF validation guide for COCOSiL beta testing with 50-100 testers.

## Key Components

### Week-by-Week Breakdown
- **Week 0 (Prep)**: Tool setup, tester recruitment, hypothesis setting
- **Week 1**: Initial 25 testers, baseline data collection
- **Week 2**: Expand to 40 more testers, deep-dive interviews, NPS measurement
- **Week 3**: Improvement implementation, re-validation
- **Week 4**: Final data collection, PMF verdict, report creation

### Success Metrics (All 4 Required)
1. Weekly retention rate: 50%+
2. PMF survey: 40%+ "very disappointed"
3. NPS: 40+
4. Diagnosis completion rate: 80%+

### Tools & Templates Provided
- Email templates (welcome, reminders, updates, surveys)
- Interview scripts (discovery, journey, usability)
- Data collection sheets (Airtable/Google Sheets)
- Dashboard configuration (Mixpanel, GA4, Hotjar)
- Slack community structure

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions
1. Low retention → Onboarding improvement, reminders
2. Low survey response → Shorter surveys, better timing, incentives
3. Data overload → Focus on North Star metric (diagnosis completion rate)
4. Biased tester mix → Quota management by persona
5. Slow iteration → Decision guardrails, pre-allocated dev bandwidth

## Next Steps for Project Owner
1. Review guide and customize to project specifics
2. Set up tools (GA4, Mixpanel, Typeform, Notion/Airtable)
3. Recruit 80+ testers to waitlist
4. Prepare welcome pack (Loom video, FAQ, onboarding checklist)
5. Schedule Week 0 prep activities 3-5 days before beta launch
