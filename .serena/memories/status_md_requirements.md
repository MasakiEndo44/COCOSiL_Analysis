# Status.md Creation Requirements

Based on the `/sc:index` request to create both "Overview.md „Å® Status.md", I need to create Status.md focusing on:

## Key Differences from Overview.md
- Overview.md: High-level system description, architecture, features
- Status.md: Detailed implementation status, metrics, progress tracking

## Status.md Content Structure
1. **Implementation Progress**: Detailed feature completion percentages
2. **Quality Metrics**: Code quality, test coverage, performance benchmarks
3. **Recent Development**: Latest changes, bug fixes, improvements
4. **Technical Debt**: Known issues, planned improvements
5. **Development Pipeline**: Next priorities, blocked items
6. **Performance Status**: API response times, system health
7. **Testing Status**: Coverage reports, test suite health

## Focus Areas
- Quantitative progress tracking
- Technical quality assessment
- Development velocity and blockers
- System performance and reliability metrics
